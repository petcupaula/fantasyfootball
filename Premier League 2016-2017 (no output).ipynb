The FDR is designed to help FPL managers plan their transfer and team selection strategy and is reviewed on a weekly basis.\n",
    "# The ICT Index is a football statistical index developed specifically to assess a player as an FPL asset. It uses match event data to generate a single score for three key areas – Influence, Creativity and Threat. These figures then combine to create an individual’s ICT Index score. It condenses more than 40 match event statistics into four distinct scores. These offer a view on player performance for factors that are known to produce FPL points.\n",
    "#   1. Influence: Influence is the first measurement - this evaluates the degree to which that player has made an impact on a match, or matches over the season. It takes into account events and actions that could directly or indirectly effect the match outcome. At the very top level these are decisive actions like goals and assists. However, the Influence score also processes significant defensive actions to analyse the effectiveness of defenders and goalkeepers.\n",
    "#   2. Creativity: Creativity assesses player performance in terms of producing goal scoring opportunities for others. It can be used as a guide to identify the players most likely to supply assists. While this analyses frequency of passing and crossing, it also considers pitch location and the incisiveness of the final ball.\n",
    "#   3. Threat: Threat is the third measure, producing a value that examines a player’s threat on goal; it therefore gauges those individuals most likely to score goals. While attempts are the key action, the Index looks at pitch location, giving greater weight to actions that are regarded as the best openings to register a goal. All three of these scores are then combined to create an overall ICT Index score. That then offers a single figure that presents a view on that player as an FPL asset.\n"
